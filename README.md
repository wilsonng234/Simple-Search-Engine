# Simple Search Engine

The project aims to develop a robust and efficient search engine that can crawl and index web pages and enable users to search for relevant webpages based on the query provided. The project is implemented based on the Java Spring Framework. The frontend of the search engine is developed using React.js. The backend of the search engine is powered by MongoDB, a NoSQL document-oriented database that enables fast and flexible data storage and retrieval.
